# Python - Object-relational mapping
This project aims to bring together Python and Databases through the process of **Object Relational Mapping**.  The main difference between this directory and the previous two [SQL - Introduction](/SQL_introduction/) and [SQL - more queries](/SQL_more_queries/) is that we will be using Python exclusively to access Databases.

The main focus of this directory will be in using `MySQLdb` module to understand how we can create SQL queries through a python program and `SQLAlchemy` to understand *ORM* patterns in Python and facilitate object persistance in our programs.
