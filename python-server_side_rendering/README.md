# Python Server-Side Rendering
This directory will explore **Server-Side Rendering** (**SSR**) through the use of python. **SSR** is a powerful technique where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as fully formed HTML. This contrasts with client-side rendering, where the browser builds the web page using JavaScript and dynamic data. In the following exercises I will implement **SSR** using Python and Flask, leveraging the **Jinja** templating engine to create dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications.

## What will be covered:
* Understand the concepts of server-side rendering and how it differs from client-side rendering.
* Learn the benefits of using server-side rendering in web development.
* Implement SSR in Python using the Flask framework.
* Utilize Jinja templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages.
* Read and display data from various sources including JSON, CSV, and SQLite databases.
* Handle dynamic content and user inputs in web applications.
