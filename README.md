# Higher level programming
This repository serves as an introduction ad exploration to higher level programming languages.
Its purpose is to familiarize ourselves with languages such as **Python**, as well as multi-language coding environments.

## [Python - Hello World](/python-hello_world/)
In this directory we start playing with Python and its built in string manipulations such as slicing and concatination.

## [Python - if, else, loops, and functions](/python-if_else_loops_functions/)
In this directory we explore conditional statements, the basics of writing loops, and writing functions in Python.
It also serves with familiarization with the importance of indentation of this language.

## [Python - import & modules](/python-import_modules/)
This directory serves as the introduction for creating python modules.  Importing and using functions from external files (specifically, created modules).  Using the built in Python function `dir()`.  Preventing code sripts from being executed when importing.  Finally, using command line arguments in Python with the help of built in libraries.

## [Python - Data Structures](/python-data_structures/)
This direcory is an introduction to built in data structures in Python.  These data structures include lists, tuples, and the like.
