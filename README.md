# Higher level programming
This repository serves as an introduction ad exploration to higher level programming languages.
Its purpose is to familiarize ourselves with languages such as **Python**, as well as multi-language coding environments.

## [Python - Hello World](/python-hello_world/)
In this directory we start playing with Python and its built in string manipulations such as slicing and concatination.

## [Python - if, else, loops, and functions](/python-if_else_loops_functions/)
In this directory we explore conditional statements, the basics of writing loops, and writing functions in Python.
It also serves with familiarization with the importance of indentation of this language.
