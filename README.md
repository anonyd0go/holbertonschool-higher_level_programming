# Higher level programming
This repository serves as an introduction ad exploration to higher level programming languages.
Its purpose is to familiarize ourselves with languages such as **Python**, as well as multi-language coding environments.

## [Python - Hello World](/python-hello_world/)
In this directory we start playing with Python and its built in string manipulations such as slicing and concatination.

## [Python - if, else, loops, and functions](/python-if_else_loops_functions/)
In this directory we explore conditional statements, the basics of writing loops, and writing functions in Python.
It also serves with familiarization with the importance of indentation of this language.

## [Python - import & modules](/python-import_modules/)
This directory serves as the introduction for creating python modules.  Importing and using functions from external files (specifically, created modules).  Using the built in Python function `dir()`.  Preventing code sripts from being executed when importing.  Finally, using command line arguments in Python with the help of built in libraries.

## [Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](/python-data_structures/)
This direcory is an introduction to built in data structures in Python.  In this directoroy we will focus on lists and tuples and some of their common  methods. We will also explore sequences, tuple unpacking, sequence unpacking, and list comprehension.

## [Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](/python-more_data_structures/)
This directory serves as an introduction to the Python built in data structures of `dictionaries` and `sets`. We will understand what each of these data structures are, the differences between previously studied data structures, their common methods, and when to use them.  This directory will also look at lambda functions and the map, reduce, filter functions.

## [Python - Exceptions](/python-exceptions/)
This directory will help us introduc the concept of exeptions, the difference between them and errors, when and where to use exceptions, how to handle these exceptions, and how to implement your own exceptions.

## [Python - Test-driven development](/python-test_driven_development/)
This directory serves as an introduction to the python testing environmnet during developement.
It will include interactive tests, their importance, writing Docstrings, writing module and function documentation, conductiong tests with basic option flags, and finding edge cases.

## [Python - Classes and Objects](/python-classes/)
This directory explores the concepts of creating classes and using objects with Python in an OOP environment.
The goal is to understand what are classes, objects, and instances.  What an attribute is when refering to these concepts.  The difference between private, protected, and public attributes.  How the `self` word is used inside class declarations.  Understanding the `__init__` method. Among other core OOP concepts.

## [Python - More Classes and Objects](/python-more_classes/)
In this directory, we will keep exploring classes and objects.
We will study themes related to class instance attributes, class methods and static methods, `__str__` and `__repr__` methods as well as other `__x__` variables.

## [Python - Inheritance](/python-inheritance/)
In this directory we will dive deeper into classes in python.  We will explore topics such as inheritance, superclass, subclasses, polymorphosm, and several other topics.

## [Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces](/python-abc/)
In this directory we will explore:
* **Abstract Classes**: Understand and apply abstract classes to define common interfaces while enforcing certain levels of class completeness.
* **Interfaces and Duck Typing**: Grasp the concept of interfaces and duck typing to ensure that objects adhere to a specific contract or protocol.
* **Subclassing Standard Base Classes**: Learn to extend standard base classes like lists, dictionaries, and iterators to create custom data structures with specialized behavior.
* **Method Overriding**: Employ method overriding to alter or enhance the behavior of base class methods.
* **Multiple Inheritance**: Understand and apply multiple inheritance to form complex relationships between classes.
* **Mixins**: Utilize mixins to compose behavior across unrelated classes.

## [Python - Input/Output](/python-input_output/)
In this directory, we will explore input and output manipulations throuh python.  The focus will be on file manipulation (read, write, transversal).  We will also use command line parameters for Python scripts.
We will also explore `JSON` files. The focus will be on what they are and how to translate `Python` source code into a `JSON` file and vice versa. The concepts of serialization and deserialization will also be explored

## [Python - Serialization](/python-serialization/)
In this directory we will delve into how data can be transformed and comunicated with different parts of a system and between systems.  It is meant to enhance our understanding and practical skills when handling real-world applications.  The methods we sill explore are **marshalling** and **serialization**.

## [RESTful API](/restful-api/)
This directory explores the concept of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/HTTPs) with the goal to thuroughly understand how data is transfered between systems in modern day.  Deep API development with python will be studied as well as security, authorization, and authentication requirements.  Finally we will enphasize the importance of standards and documentation for API usability and maintenance.

## [SQL - Introduction](/SQL_introduction/)
In this repository we will get an introduction to relational databases through SQL (Standard Query Language).  We will use MySQL to create a database.  We will also learn how to create and modify the data as well as how to traverse a database through both DDL (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`) and DML (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).  We will also explore how to use subqueries and creating SQL functions.

## [SQL - More queries](/SQL_more_queries/)
In this directory we will be exploring more SQL concepts.  We will create and delete users and assign privileges to the users.  We will understand MySQL constraints when creating and designing detabases. We will utilize different `JOIN`s and `UNION`s to retrieve data from multiple tables at the same time.  Finally we will look into using subqueries for fetching data from our databases.
