# Higher level programming
This repository serves as an introduction ad exploration to higher level programming languages.
Its purpose is to familiarize ourselves with languages such as **Python**, as well as multi-language coding environments.

## [Python - Hello World](/python-hello_world/)
In this directory we start playing with Python and its built in string manipulations such as slicing and concatination.

## [Python - if, else, loops, and functions](/python-if_else_loops_functions/)
In this directory we explore conditional statements, the basics of writing loops, and writing functions in Python.
It also serves with familiarization with the importance of indentation of this language.

## [Python - import & modules](/python-import_modules/)
This directory serves as the introduction for creating python modules.  Importing and using functions from external files (specifically, created modules).  Using the built in Python function `dir()`.  Preventing code sripts from being executed when importing.  Finally, using command line arguments in Python with the help of built in libraries.

## [Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](/python-data_structures/)
This direcory is an introduction to built in data structures in Python.  In this directoroy we will focus on lists and tuples and some of their common  methods. We will also explore sequences, tuple unpacking, sequence unpacking, and list comprehension.

## [Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](/python-more_data_structures/)
This directory serves as an introduction to the Python built in data structures of `dictionaries` and `sets`. We will understand what each of these data structures are, the differences between previously studied data structures, their common methods, and when to use them.  This directory will also look at lambda functions and the map, reduce, filter functions.

## [Python - Exceptions](/python-exceptions/)
This directory will help us introduc the concept of exeptions, the difference between them and errors, when and where to use exceptions, how to handle these exceptions, and how to implement your own exceptions.

## [Python - Test-driven development](/python-test_driven_development/)
This directory serves as an introduction to the python testing environmnet during developement.
It will include interactive tests, their importance, writing Docstrings, writing module and function documentation, conductiong tests with basic option flags, and finding edge cases.
